# My website api

This Nestjs API was used to pull live data from WakaTime, Github and StackOverflow for [my website](https://nasserkessas.netlify.app).

This project was converted to use AWS lambda functions, S3 buckets and EventBridge, you can check this out at [this repo](https://github.com/nasserkessas/website-s3-lambda).
